GCM client for Android, and GCM server written in Python 2.7

# Neither the PythonServer nor the AndroidClient is working. And probably won't for a time

But you can use this project if you want to see how to use GCM on server-side with Python. For how to write an GCM Android client see [Google Cloud Messaging for Android](http://developer.android.com/google/gcm/index.html)
